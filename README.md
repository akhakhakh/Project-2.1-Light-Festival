# IT-2D Project: Light Festival

This project consists of the interactive arcade machine. This repository includes the launcher with the games, and the project files with the game's code and assets.

---

## Prerequisites
- Install Godot (Make sure it is the latest version)
- Executable files are .exe (Might not work on OS that is not Windows)


---

## 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Project-2.1-Light-Festival
```

---

## 2. Run launcher
- Inside the arcade-interactive-machine folder there will be an executable for the game launcher (Arcade Interactive Machine.exe)

---

## 3. Check code
- Each folder that is not the launcher's folder is the project file of each game. The folders are structure so that it should be easy to navigate to the desired files.
- .tscn files are scenes that contain and display each part of the game.
- .gd and .gdshader files consist of the scripts that are attached to .tscn files.
- The rest of the files are assets that are imported and used in the scenes.

## 4. Brief description of each game
- <b>Simon Says:</b> A memory-based game that requires the player to repeat the sequence of flashing lights in the correct order.
- <b>Stacker:</b> A skill-based game that requires the player to stack the squares on top of each layers as the squares move left and right, and the game progressively speeds up until the player reaches the end.
- <b>Rhythm Game:</b> A timing-based game that requires the player to press a button as the note falls on top of it, to the timing of the song being played.
